# Data_Analysis_Preprocesssing-Modeling-Visualization_RShiny
This is a complete data analysis project using R shiny. 

## Purpose
1. Using EDA to find the data distribution, missingness pattern, outlier pattern, correlationship among variables.
2. Based on the EDA conclusion, using the right strategies and processes to deal with missing values.
3. Organize the preprocessing pipeline in a scientific way to meet the assumptions of the model.
4. Using cross validation to do the model training.
5. Model tuning.
6. Choose the best model and apply it to the test dataset then evaluate the model performance and interprete the model.
7. Use the reaction expressions in Shiny to perform user interaction work, which visually displays the influence of check boxes, sliders, and selectors on the model.


## Output
1. The report writes all the process in detail, please refer to the Doc folder.
2. Shiny Visualization https://sch405.shinyapps.io/Data423_Assignment2_ShiChen/
