# Data_Analysis_Preprocesssing-Modeling-Visualization_RShiny
This is a complete data analysis project using R shiny. 

## Purpose
1. Using EDA to find the data distribution, missingness pattern, outlier pattern, correlationship among variables.
2. Based on the EDA conclusion, using the right strategies and processes to deal with missing values.
3. Organize the preprocessing pipeline in a scientific way to meet the assumptions of the model.
4. Using cross validation to do the model training.
5. Model tuning.
5. Choose the best model and apply it to the test dataset then evaluate the model performance and interprete the model.

## Output
The report writes all the process in detail, please refer to the Doc folder.
